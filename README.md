# Art of Code Dojo 4 - String Calculator

On this session we'll build a string calculator with support to the sum operation with TypeScript and time slot pairing.
The focus of this session is to practice and experiment with TypeScript. The tests were already written ahead of time and will guide you 'step-by-step' to implement the kata.

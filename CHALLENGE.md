## JavaScript Coding exercises
Here you'll find some code challenges to exercise some JS base concepts, like creating functions, concatenating strings, sorting, etc.

### How this works?
- To get started you'll need 'NodeJs' installed.
    + after cloning run 'npm install'
- To run the exercises use the 'npm test' command.
- All exercises will run one at a time. 
    + The challenges may have 1 or more test cases.
    + **All test cases should pass before you're able to go to the next challenge.**
- All your code should be written in the `myCode.js` file.
- Pay close attention to the tests outputs, they'll will give you valuable information, like errors, the test expectations, inputs, so on and so forth.
- We encourage you to run the tests (npm test) after every modification you do to the `myCode` file, so you can see the incremental changes on the outputs.
- START THE SOLUTIONS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE. Even returning a hard-coded value is a good start.
